# VR_Final: Target Designation Simulator

## Premise
This vr experience is intended to give a fun perspective on military laser designation for targeted airstrikes. The user is stationary standing on a cloud above a sprawling city. The user has a remote control which connects to the motion capture system. The remote control simulates a laser.

When the user points the laser somewhere in the world, and clicks the trigger, an air strike is targeted for that location. When the bomb hits the ground and emits it's payload of candy canes, local buildings are sent flying all over the city.

The game is really just a sandbox: the user has no objective other than to have fun.
